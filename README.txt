Team Hot Handzzz We took the excel data and put it into a database using MySQL. We also created a responsive website. We are still trying to implement our database as a Java Applet onto our website. We were not able to render the charts based on the company data or allow users to search based on company name or symbol. We were also unable to derive a Variable based on the company data to recommend whether to buy or sell. In short we partially completed Level 1 but were unable to complete Level 2 and 3. In addition to completing Levels 2 and 3, we wish we had further time to add sentiment analysis, a way to import articles from the Wall Street Journal or the ability to parse through quarterly reports to further aid research.We also wanted to explore a way to share research between analysts so that in addition to raw data or the articles imported from the web, we could incorporate insights and recommendations from fellow analysts.
